    <p>GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service.
         It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality
          of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such
           as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.</p>
            
            <p> offers both plans for private and free repositories on the same account which are commonly used
                 to host open-source software projects.
                  As of April 2017, GitHub reports having almost 20 million users and 57 million repositories,
                   making it the largest host of source code in the world.</p>
            
           <p> GitHub has a mascot called Octocat, a cat with five tentacles and a human-like face.</p>
           <p><h3>GitHub</h3>
            <hr>
                Development of the GitHub platform began on 1 October 2007. The site was launched in April 2008
                 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months
                  prior as a beta release.</p>
                
                <P>Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface 
                and all of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users 
                to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins have also been created 
                by GitHub and other third parties that integrate with the platform.</P>
                
                <p>The site provides social networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis 
                (using wiki software called Gollum) and a social network graph to display how developers work on their 
                versions ("forks") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.</p>
                
                <p>A user must create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be 
                browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to discuss, 
                manage, create repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and review changes to code.</p>
                
                <p>The software that runs GitHub was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub, Inc. 
                developers Chris Wanstrath,[13] PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner.</p>
